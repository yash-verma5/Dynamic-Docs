prompt = "<objective>\nExecute small, ad-hoc tasks with GSD guarantees (atomic commits, STATE.md tracking).\n\nQuick mode is the same system with a shorter path:\n- Spawns gsd-planner (quick mode) + gsd-executor(s)\n- Quick tasks live in `.planning/quick/` separate from planned phases\n- Updates STATE.md \"Quick Tasks Completed\" table (NOT ROADMAP.md)\n\n**Default:** Skips research, plan-checker, verifier. Use when you know exactly what to do.\n\n**`--full` flag:** Enables plan-checking (max 2 iterations) and post-execution verification. Use when you want quality guarantees without full milestone ceremony.\n</objective>\n\n<execution_context>\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/quick.md\n</execution_context>\n\n<context>\n$ARGUMENTS\n\nContext files are resolved inside the workflow (`init quick`) and delegated via `<files_to_read>` blocks.\n</context>\n\n<process>\nExecute the quick workflow from @./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/quick.md end-to-end.\nPreserve all workflow gates (validation, task description, planning, execution, state updates, commits).\n</process>"
